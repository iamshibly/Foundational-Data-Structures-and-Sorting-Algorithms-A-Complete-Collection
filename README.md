# Foundational Data Structures and Sorting Algorithms: A Complete Collection

This repository provides a comprehensive collection of foundational data structures and sorting algorithms implemented in C. It covers various key topics, from basic operations in stacks, queues, and linked lists to sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort and Merge Sort. Each program demonstrates practical implementations, along with additional topics like search algorithms and algorithm performance analysis.

## Topics Covered

- **Stacks**: Basic operations, including push, pop, peek, and additional applications such as prime factorization and decimal to binary conversion.
- **Queues**: Basic queue operations and advanced concepts like using two queues to simulate a priority queue.
- **Linked Lists**: Detailed implementations of single linked lists with functions to insert, delete, reverse, and traverse nodes.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Common sorting techniques such as Bubble Sort and Merge Sort, along with performance comparisons.
- **Search Algorithms**: Implementations of Linear Search and Binary Search algorithms.
- **Miscellaneous**: Various algorithmic exercises, including a time difference analysis between Merge Sort and Bubble Sort.
